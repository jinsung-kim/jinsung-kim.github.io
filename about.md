### What is this?

Welcome...
A place to where I write my thoughts on books I have read. Due to the volume of books that I read, it is often easy for myself to forget which to recommend to others. For this reason, this page is mainly for myself to reflect on the literature that I come across.

I try to only review books that I have completed - which is the reason the ratings skew towards higher scores. Books not fully completed are marked with a **DNF**. I do go back sometimes to update scores.
