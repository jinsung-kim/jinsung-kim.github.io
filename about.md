### What is this?

Welcome...
A place to where I write my short thoughts on recent books I have read. I have no intention of this becoming big. It is mainly for myself to reflect on the literature that I read.

I only review books that I have completed - which is the reason the ratings skew towards higher scores.

### Particular Topics I Enjoy Reading
Fashion (runway and cultural), art in general, biographies, philosophy

### Favorites?
In no particular order:
Ametora
Shoe Dog
Steve Jobs
Can't Hurt Me
