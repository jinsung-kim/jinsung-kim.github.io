### What is this?

Welcome...
A place to where I write my thoughts on recent books I have read. Due to the volume of books that I read, it is often easy for myself to forget which to recommend to others. For this reason, this site is mainly for others to find interesting books and for myself to reflect on the literature that I come across. I tend to retain more information when I write.

I try to only review books that I have completed or have at least read more than half of (this is a rare case) - which is the reason the ratings skew towards higher scores.

### Particular topics I enjoy

Certain categories of art, biographies, philosophy. I lean more in favor of nonfiction writing.

### Favorites?

In no particular order:

- [The White Album (or anything Joan Didion)](https://jinsung-kim.github.io/The-White-Album/)
- [Ametora](https://jinsung-kim.github.io/ametora/)
- [Shoe Dog](https://jinsung-kim.github.io/shoe-dog/)
- [Steve Jobs](https://jinsung-kim.github.io/steve-jobs/)
- [Brave New World](https://jinsung-kim.github.io/Brave-New-World/)
- [The Stranger](https://jinsung-kim.github.io/The-Stranger/)

I have another writing project that you can view [here](https://archived-js.web.app/) where you can see my inner monologue about my other interests.

Thanks for stopping by :)
