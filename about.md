### What is this?

Welcome...
A place to where I write my thoughts on recent books I have read. I have no intention of this becoming big. Due to the volume of books that I read, it is often easy for myself to forget which to recommend to others. For this reason, this site is mainly for others to find interesting books and for myself to reflect on the literature that I come across. I try to keep the reviews spoiler free :)

I try to only review books that I have completed or have at least read more than half of - which is the reason the ratings skew towards higher scores.

### Particular topics I enjoy
Certain categories of art, biographies, philosophy. Books that challenge the rationale of humans and make me rethink about my life.
If you want to recommend me a book, send me a direct message [@codejin_](https://instagram.com/codejin_/) on Instagram.

Thanks for stopping by :)
