### What is this?

Welcome...
A place to where I write my short thoughts on recent books I have read. I have no intention of this becoming big. It is mainly for myself to reflect on the literature that I read.

I only review books that I have completed - which is the reason the ratings skew towards higher scores.

### Particular topics I enjoy
Fashion (runway and cultural), art in general, biographies, philosophy. I am more of a nonfiction reader.

### Favorites?
In no particular order:
- [Ametora](https://jinsung-kim.github.io/ametora/)
- [Shoe Dog](https://jinsung-kim.github.io/shoe-dog/)
- [Steve Jobs](https://jinsung-kim.github.io/steve-jobs/)
- [Can't Hurt Me](https://jinsung-kim.github.io/Cant-Hurt-Me/)

I typically listen to <a href="https://lofi.co/" target="_blank">this</a> when I read :)

Thanks for stopping by.
