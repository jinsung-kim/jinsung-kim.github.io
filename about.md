### What is this?

Welcome...
A place to where I write my short thoughts on recent books I have read. I have no intention of this becoming big. Due to the volume of books that I read, it is often easy for myself to forget which to recommend to others. For this reason, this site is mainly for myself to reflect on the literature that I read.

I try to only review books that I have completed - which is the reason the ratings skew towards higher scores.

### Particular topics I enjoy
Fashion (runway and cultural), certain categories of art, biographies, philosophy. I am more of a nonfiction reader, but am looking to branch into other genres (such as science fiction). 
If you want to recommend me a book, send me a direct message [@codejin_](https://instagram.com/codejin_/) on Instagram, it would be greatly appreciated!
