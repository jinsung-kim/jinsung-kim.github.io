### What is this?

Welcome...
A place to where I write my thoughts on recent books I have read. I have no intention of this becoming big. Due to the volume of books that I read, it is often easy for myself to forget which to recommend to others. For this reason, this site is mainly for others to find interesting books and for myself to reflect on the literature that I come across.

I try to only review books that I have completed - which is the reason the ratings skew towards higher scores. There are many books that I drop in between. My rating system is relatively simple with a 1 to 10 scale. Anything above a 5 generated overall positive thoughts and was an enjoyable experience.

There is no commercial incentive for this website, which is how you can verify that my reviews are genuine. There is absolutely no money involved, all thoughts are my own, and I will never sell out.

### Particular topics I enjoy
Certain categories of art, biographies, philosophy. I am more of a nonfiction reader, but am looking to branch into other genres (such as science fiction). I like exploring the human psyche through literature.
If you want to recommend me a book, send me a direct message [@codejin_](https://instagram.com/codejin_/) on Instagram.
