### What is this?

Welcome...
A place to where I write my thoughts on recent books I have read. Due to the volume of books that I read, it is often easy for myself to forget which to recommend to others. For this reason, this site is mainly for others to find interesting books and for myself to reflect on the literature that I come across. I tend to retain more information when I write.

I try to only review books that I have completed or have at least read more than half of - which is the reason the ratings skew towards higher scores. Books not completed are marked with a **DNF**.

### Particular topics I enjoy

Biographies, philosophy, short essays/journalism. I lean towards non fiction, but am open minded to all suggestions :)

### Favorites?

In no particular order:

- [The White Album (or anything Joan Didion)](https://jinsung-kim.github.io/The-White-Album/)
- [Ametora](https://jinsung-kim.github.io/ametora/)
- [Shoe Dog](https://jinsung-kim.github.io/shoe-dog/)
- [Steve Jobs](https://jinsung-kim.github.io/steve-jobs/)
- [Brave New World](https://jinsung-kim.github.io/Brave-New-World/)
- [The Stranger](https://jinsung-kim.github.io/The-Stranger/)

If you made it this far, thanks for checking my little pocket of the internet.
