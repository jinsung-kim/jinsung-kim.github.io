<p>In <em>Chronicle of a Death Foretold</em>, Nobel Laureate Gabriel García Márquez recalls a murder in the town Sucre, Colombia. Inspired by a real incident, Márquez explores the idea of collective guilt and society’s fixation on honor.</p>

<p>Rather than following traditional storytelling methods, Márquez employs the perspective of an unnamed narrator in a nonlinear manner to recount the murder of Santiago Nasar—twenty years after the fact. The opening paragraph immediately reveals Nasar’s fate:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the morning that they were going to kill him, Santiago Nasar got up at five-thirty in the morning to wait for the boat the bishop was coming on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The writing blends a journalistic approach—incorporating interviews with townspeople—with a fictional narrative. Ambiguity is a central tenet of the novel; only through countless recollections of the same events from numerous bystanders does the reader begin to uncover why the murder happened.</p>

<p>The story reveals that the night before Nasar’s murder, a lavish wedding takes place between the wealthy Bayardo San Román and the young Angela Vicario. When it is discovered that Angela is not a virgin, she is returned to her family on the night of her wedding. Pressured by her twin brothers to name the man who dishonored her, she gives them a name—one they accept without question.</p>

<p>There is a strange sense of dread in the book because, as the narrative unfolds backwards, it becomes increasingly clear that everyone knew what was going to happen, yet no one intervened to stop it.</p>

<p>The murder itself is less an individual act and more a product of the culture of Colombia at the time. The failure of an entire society to prevent the crime reflects rigid gender roles—where marriage is not about love but about duty, an exchange in which a woman’s worth is measured by her innocence, beauty, and ability to maintain a household.</p>

<p>In the end, it is never revealed whether the murder was “justified”—or if Angela even named the true perpetrator. Nasar, though by no means a perfect man, becomes a Christ-like martyr, sacrificed on the altar of honor. If I took anything away from this novella, it was its masterful portrayal of culture and complicity. It only takes one person to prevent a tragedy. A society that refuses to uphold justice inevitably becomes an accomplice to its own tragedies.</p>
