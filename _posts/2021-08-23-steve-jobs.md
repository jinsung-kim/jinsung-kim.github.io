As someone who has always been curious about Silicon Valley during its come up, this book really scratched that itch for me. This book covers Steve Jobs' life as a whole, from the story of his adoption to his unfortunate end. It goes through in intricate detail each product that Jobs envisioned (whether good or bad), his ideology for his products, and the incredible team that he built to create the company that we all love today. He revolutionized technological and entertainment industries by successfully blending technology and the liberal arts - giving consumers products they didn't even know they wanted.

A good biography must contain three components. An interesting subject, an engaging narrative, and proper accuracy/journalism. This book has all three. Walter Isaacson does an incredible job covering a difficult subject - all of Job's quirks, his dirty hippie life, the questionable decisions that he made, and even his ability to defy reality are covered in interesting fashion.

Whether it is the way the book is presented or the way each chapter has key characters and themes, it is difficult to put this one down. This book is definitely a longer read, but if you like Apple and are curious to uncover the mind of the genius that envisioned it, this book is definitely worth your time. 

**Overall Rating: 9/10**
