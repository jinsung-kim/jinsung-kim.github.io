The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a young adult novel written by Stephen Chbosky in 1999. It follows an introverted protagonist who refers to himself as Charlie, as he writes letters to an anonymous friend that he wishes he had. It goes over his first year of high school, and covers coming of age themes such as looking for acceptance, emotional growth, and love.

I came into The Perks of Being a Wallflower knowing about its hype, and was unsure what to expect. Typically, hype raises my expectations of novels too high, and leaves me in disappointment. However, I can safely say that The Perks of Being a Wallflower lives up to the hype. To me, this book is a more modern version of The Catcher in the Rye.

I really enjoyed how Charlie developed throughout the novel. His character development can be seen in his writing of the letters and his interactions with his friends. His battle with depression and anxiety feel authentic. Those raw feelings, really grew on me as I kept reading. Charlie is not the only character worth mentioning. The other characters (particularly Patrick and Sam) are also very well written. Interactions flow naturally and each character seems to serve a purpose for being in Charlie's life.

One thing that didn't really land with me was Charlie's inconsistent emotional state. It feels as if he sweeps the things he experiences and feels under the rug, in a way that leaves me uncertain if he has really progressed. At times Charlie seems wise beyond his age, considering his quite unconventional way of thinking. Other times, he regresses into his childlike state and fails to read a situation or answer a simple question. While this led to some frustrating moments, it still seemed to serve a purpose in the larger picture.

Despite his flaws as a character, I still enjoyed how reflective and appreciative Charlie was in his letters. His perspective of life is suprisingly refreshing; he reminded me that it is okay to be emotional, and to be there for others the way they are there for me. His writing left me with a nostalgic feeling of my high school experience, painting a very vivid picture of the little things in life that make it worth living. I'm excited to watch the movie next.

**Overall Rating: 7.5/10**
