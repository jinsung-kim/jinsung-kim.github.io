On my recent trip to the Getty Museum out in Los Angeles, I purchased the book “Artists on Art” by Holly Black, a short color book of the world’s most renown artists. My intention with this book was to be more acquainted with contemporary artists and research different creative processes of a wide variety of creatives around the world. In it, Holly Black highlights a certain piece from each of the fifty or so artists, and briefly covers what the artist is known for. Five in particular have interviews with Black, in which they provide a bit more insight to their perspective and work.

The drastic shift in art always challenged me and intimidated me. While old art (from the French, Italian and Dutch) throughout the 1600 to 1800 AD seems relatively straightforward, contemporary art always struck me as odd and impossible to grasp with its unique structure and vague messages. According to historians, this shift to modern art in the twentieth century is attributed to the digital camera, which made portrait painting obsolete as cameras blew technical drawings out of the water. This book offered me the right lenses to approach this technical and creative shift in a way that it could be more digestible.

The artists seem to be chosen at random - there were some that were certainly important, but there were a bunch that I was disappointed to be left out. There was no pattern; contemporary artists were mixed in with performers, and old masters (of the likes of Michelangelo and Rembrandt) were sprinkled in between the pages. While this irked me a bit, some creatives that I never heard of left a mark on me with their showcasing.

The book offered short insights onto the different approaches of creatives. It really reminded me how impactful the backgrounds of each artist truly is - how war can lead to destructive and painful art, how social constructs can oppress identity, and how certain cultures lead to certain art styles. The controversial ideas, models, and execution of each pushed me to find my own lane in the way I create my digital works. One point that really stuck out was that art in itself needs a reason to exist - a breathe of air through an intricate idea, whether this is technical skill or visionary.

You shouldn’t expect much from this book, because each artist really gets two small pages (one of which is a picture). For me, this book will really just be a coffee table book - easy to dive in to a random page and learn something new, but lacking true substance to understand a person with great depth. This book served as an excellent bridge to the deeper art world as I dive into more textbooks unpacking each historical movement in relation to its era. Who else would be included in this book in a hundred years?
