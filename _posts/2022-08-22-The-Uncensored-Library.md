> Minecraft reveals uncensored library full of banned journalism.

![The library](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2020-03-17-at-3-07-16-pm-1584471880.png)

This is my first non-book review in which I will showcase the Uncensored Library. The Uncensored Library is a digital home of press freedom dedicated to countries with banned books and media sources. In a world of internet surveillance, blockages, and censorship, it empowers the younger generation by giving them unlimited freedom, even in countries with no press freedom. The most interesting thing about this project that it is entirely hosted in the sandbox game Minecraft.

This is done by downloading a Minecraft map in which an entire library is built (or alternatively join a server). Players can walk through this virtual world and find sources banned in their country without being detected, because the source text of the books are hidden and compressed in the game files. Players can read books in Minecraft and go through blocked journalism and various content, thus granting everyone access to the truth.

I simply wanted to highlight how technology can be used for good, how this is the way it was intended - to connect with the next generation while democratizing information for all. Here is the link to their website, I encourage you all to check it out: https://uncensoredlibrary.com/en
