> If we make enough money, have enough success, then we should be free from all strugglesâ€”or more accurately, our struggles are no longer valid. But what most of us find after a while, and much to our surprise, is that even with all the cash and prizes, the question of purpose remains. Pain and suffering still remain.

As a Warriors fan, I really appreciate everything Andre Iguodala has done for our team. While he was certainly not the best player (and not even a starter), what he sacrificed for the team during our championship runs was nothing short of spectacular. The Sixth Man is a memoir by Andre Iguodala, as it covers his journey in the NBA, and the values that got him so far into his decorated career.

What I immediately liked from the beginning was how much he covered in detail the inner workings of many basketball things - such as free agency, his teammates, media coverage, and his playtime. The play-by-play scenes were really great, because I could go back to video footage and see certain things that he was thinking of as he played. While most regularly readers might not like this, I found it to be good (for a lack of a better word).

Other than the basketball, the rest of the book was just okay for me. I was really hoping for some more information about his personal life balance with his profession, but he left many gaps. The writing was also a little shaky for certain chapters, especially the few things he wasn't talking about basketball.

While this book was interesting for me, it was difficult to push through some of the chapters, simply due to the fact that it didn't resonate with me as much as I thought it would. The book reminded me that despite who we are and what we do, we still all face very basic questions and a sense of purpose. Even if we think NBA players have it easy due to the money that they make, everyone has their ups and downs.

**Overall Rating: 6/10**
