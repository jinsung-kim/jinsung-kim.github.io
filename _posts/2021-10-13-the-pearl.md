> For it is said that humans are never satisfied, that you give them one thing and they want something more. And this is said in disparagement, whereas it is one of the greatest talents the species has and one that has made it superior to animals that are satisfied with what they have.

Classics Week would be incomplete without a novel by John Steinbeck. For the fourth day of this week, I decided upon The Pearl, where Steinbeck retells a Mexican folktale, about a fisherman named Kino who finds a valuable pearl off of a shore of a small village.

Steinbeck’s skills as a masterful storyteller really carry the novel. His writing is elegant in describing scenes and culture, from the air of the village to the songs that are sung. Considering how quickly the novel moves, his writing really manages to pack a punch.

Tragedies strike within pages apart, and the demise of Kino and his family are used to deliver a very poignant tale. As Kino looks to gain wealth and status through his pearl, his intentions and characters change from a caring father to a vicious criminal. The quick transition really points out how destructive greed can be. Steinbeck’s way of symbolizing the pearl as a symbol of hope to a symbol of human destruction and evil reminded me of the materialistic themes of our society.

This book was also one of the first to introduce me to the idea of fate. Steinbeck illustrates two contrasting forces that shape life and determine destiny. Humans follow their own plans and what they desire, but uncontrollable forces such as accidents and misfortune can outweigh human desires. Steinbeck portrays the two and how they intersect violently into a civilization.

Overall, the story is captivating, despite being nothing more than a short parable. Steinbeck’s philosophy and background from California shows a lot about him as a person - his concern for the poor and marginalized, conflicts between race, and colonization of certain native cultures. While this book may not be as big as his other classics, it certain strikes a chord in my heart.
