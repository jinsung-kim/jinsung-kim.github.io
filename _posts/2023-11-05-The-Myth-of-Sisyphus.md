![The Myth of Sisyphus](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Punishment_sisyph.jpg/540px-Punishment_sisyph.jpg)

In _The Myth of Sisyphus_, Albert Camus explores the philosophy of the absurd - the intersection of the human soul that fights for meaning and the unresponsive cosmos. In this philosophical essay, Camus claims that the unreasonable silence or effort required to live in the absurdity does not justify suicide, but rather calls for more passion and revolt. The book title references the Greek myth of Sisyphus, who is condemned by the gods to roll a massive boulder up a mountain for eternity, only to see it roll back down each time he nears the summit. Despite the apparent meaninglessness of this task, Camus argues that Sisyphus's unwavering struggle epitomizes the core tenets of absurdism.

What struck me the most is how Camus tries to separate himself from the concept of absurdism being a philosophy. While he mentions the likes of Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche throughout, he criticizes how they try to describe the feeling of absurdism through a metaphysical point of view, attributing the unknown to God. Camus does not claim or ever deny that God exists because to the true absurdist - it does not matter. Camus claims, that refusing to explore the depths of absurdism as these other prominent thinkers have done, is philosophical suicide.

What struck me most was Camus' deliberate effort to distance himself from the notion of absurdism as a formal philosophy. While he makes reference to notable philosophers like Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche, he offers a critique of their approach in attempting to explain the sensation of absurdity through metaphysical lenses, often attributing the unexplainable to a divine entity. Camus, in contrast, neither affirms nor denies the existence of God because, for the true absurdist, such matters are ultimately irrelevant. Camus asserts that the refusal to dig deeper into absurdity, constitutes a form of philosophical suicide.

Having completed this book, it becomes evident where Albert Camus' mindset was when he wrote _The Stranger_. While the latter was a succinct and easily digestible work, I found this book to be remarkably challenging due to its numerous dated references and intricate ideas. I resorted to using a guide for every chapter, meticulously took notes, yet still found myself bewildered at various points. Paradoxically, my struggle to comprehend Camus' ideas feels inherently absurd, aligning with the very essence of his philosophy. Embracing Camus' call for perpetual revolt against the absurdity of existence may indeed be draining. The inherent contradiction he presents, where achieving true clarity seems unattainable, is, perhaps, the essence of his message. Despite the somber tone, I left with a strange sense of hope that I could find my own source of happiness.

> The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.
