title: The Human Condition (Classics Week)
---
> Thought and cognition are not the same. Thought, the source of art works, is manifest without transformation or transfiguration in all great philosophy, whereas the chief manifestation of the cognitive processes, by which we acquire and store up knowledge, is the sciences. Cognition always pursues a definite aim, which can be set by practical considerations as well as by “idle curiosity”

For the last two days of Classics Week, I will now shift over to my non fiction favorites. In this review, I will unpack The Human Condition published by Hannah Arendt in 1958 . Hannah Arendt was a German American political theorist - who had a very impactful influence on political theory and philosophy - considered to be one of the most significant thinkers of the 20th century.

In The Human Condition, Arendt defines what she believes to be the differences in labor, work, and action, and how these concepts play into the human condition, which are the features of our being. She uses many natural events such as birth, death, and the planet to frame the perspective of humanity. She then dives into the differences of the public and private spheres of our lives. She raises a theory of how labor and industrialism changed the meaning of our lives, and in turn, the politics and prominence that society had.

This book is certainly deep. Perhaps not in the way you might imagine (in terms of reading difficulty), but certainly in the way she encourages discussion. While I have not read too much political (and to a lesser extent social) theory, what she seems to have done here is quite unique. Each proposal she brings up, could very much be an entire book on its own.

Sometimes I wish we could gather great philosophers of this generation such as Arendt, Heidegger, and Kant and have them talk out their ideas in a nice cafe.
