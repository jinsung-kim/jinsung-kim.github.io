> Most of us have two lives. The life we live, and the un-lived life within us. Between the two stands Resistance.

I found myself in a rut throughout my recent trip to LA, struggling to find things to write about and stuck trying to pursue the ideas that I had. I found it to be a herculean task to actually turn my ideas into physical form (or perhaps digital is more appropriate), and was looking for a less traditional book to try some new angles to attack my lack of productivity. In The War of Art, Steven Pressfield attempts to break down his creative process, and how it can be broken down to fight off what he refers to as “Resistance”.

“Resistance” refers to the creative block of an artist - the voice in our soul that prevents us from challenging the way we perceive the world, whether that is writing, producing, or drawing. Pressfield challenges the reader to find their calling and approach it as a professional, rather than an amateur. The first part (out of three) really hit home for me, and encouraged me to start chipping away whenever something hit me and create a model and process for the way I perceive ideas.

The good in this book really just seems to end here. Overall, the book is sloppy in all ways. It lacks focus, and the writer bounces from idea to idea so quickly, stating statistics that seem bizarre and assessing historical figures inaccurately. For instance, he claims that it was easier for Hitler to start World War 2 rather than face his rejection and continue as an artist. The ideas at first start good, but once the religious analogies and writer’s true colors show - it comes exceedingly one dimensional and arrogant. It was incredibly slow and repetitive after the first section, and stops being practical once the ideas start splitting between chapters.

The book can really just be summarized in this way - do the things that are difficult to be able to overcome creative roadblocks, ignore the outsiders when initially creating, and learn to be a professional. Even though the book was only around 190 pages, it really could have been shortened to less than 100 without losing any substance. This motivational speech fell very short for me, even though it started off with some good points. I recognize that self help books will always be a hit or miss - but few miss the mark as bad as this.

**Overall Rating: 4/10**
