> Today, the luxury industry is like Monopoly. The focus is no longer on the art of luxury; itâ€™s on the bottom line.

Dana Thomas is a fashion journalist that many consider to be a must-read in the fashion industry to understand the inner workings of everything from fabric composition to the yearly fashion cycle. Two years ago, I read half of her book _God and Kings_ about the come up of John Galliano and Lee McQueen. I could not finish due to the lengthy pointless detail that she focused on and the repetitiveness of each fashion collection she obsessed over. While I really wanted to like this book due to the topic that she covered, the ideological problems with conspicuous consumption and overall attitude towards the fashion industry disappointed me once again.

The whole point of fashion as argued by Thomas is that people can buy into the dream of being rich by owning luxury goods. Originally, luxury goods were exclusively for the rich through the great practice of haute couture. As brands increased their appetite, they shifted their focus to the middle class wanting to be like the rich, by lowering the quality of the goods and focusing on advertising and perception for profit. As brands reach the point of going public, they use cheap labor from China to produce handbags and rely on celebrities to sell their bottom line. For instance, bags are assembled in third world countries except for the handle. The almost finished bag is brought to Italy for the final product such that brands can slap on the "made in Italy" tag, as producing in a poorer country puts the brand in a negative light. Another chapter showed how each store tried to create an "artistic" unique showroom for their goods and ended up hiring the same architect once it was shown how profitable it was to design a certain way.

The book is also full of unimportant histories of each brand from Chanel to Louis Vuitton. While some context for certain chapters is needed - such as the hostile takeovers from Bernard Arnault throughout LVMH, most of the stories were pointless. Over and over again, names are mentioned to the point where it becomes impossible to remember who held which position. The only thing I could remember by the end was that no original creator in the book would have been happy with how their creation turned out in the hand of others.

This book reminded me why I dislike the fashion industry. I love clothes, the individual details and the ideas behind the clothes. However, seeing how snobby the industry is, how it preys on matieralism and wasteful behavior showed me why I should reconsider how I purchase clothes. It hurts to see the art that I love so much portrayed as just a dollar sign.

At the end of the book, Thomas doesn't exactly wrap things up well. While she makes it clear that luxury has definitely lost its original identity by changing demographics for the sake of money, she offers zero solutions to offset this problem or even provide a reason to care. There was a point in its last concluding thoughts to highlight brands that have broken the mold of greed and bag chasing or challenge the reader with how things should change. Like the other book I read, the way she settles for the easy narrative hindered me from finishing this book.
