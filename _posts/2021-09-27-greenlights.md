_Alright, alright, alright._ It's time for a review of my most recent book read, Greenlights. Greenlights is a memoir written by Matthew McConaughey. The book covers a few insightful moments of his life - including his childhood, trips to foreign continents, his search for meaning in his industry, and his search for the perfect partner. There are many pictures and diary entries of his journey thus far, and it is clear what he was trying to achieve by writing this memoir. The book is titled the way it is as McConaughey claims that life is like a traffic sign. According to him, there are moments where we are forced to wait or stop, when things don't go our way, which are yellow and red lights. Green lights are moments when life matches up with God's hand and we are given the go ahead to pursue certain opportunities and events.

It really feels like an album, and the story is told with a lot of perspective, lessons and prayers. It covers his journey to fame and success, the way he handles it, and the satisfaction of starting a family. I really enjoyed his insightful lessons through his fifty years of living. One moment that really struck out to me was his rite of passage of becoming a man, which was intertwined with his relationship with his father. The book also reminded me that we all face challenges no matter who we are, what economic situations we face, and what we have accomplished.

Some say the book is self centered and egotistical, but I personally did not find this a problem as the book was presented as a memoir. The book felt like he was really opening up and attempting to be vulnerable about his storied life. McConaughey certainly has a knack for writing, and I hope that he writes more for us throughout the rest of his career. While my path will look entirely different from his, I think his general observations hold up for everyone. Enjoy life. Make sure to look back and see how far you've come. Live it to its full potential.

**Overall Rating: 7.5/10**
