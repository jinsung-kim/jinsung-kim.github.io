_Alright, alright, alright._ Greenlights is a memoir written by Matthew McConaughey. To say this book is a memoir in the traditional sense is a bit misleading, as the book really covers insightful moments of his life. He focuses in on aspects of his life that really shaped who he was, and includes snippets of his diary.

It really feels like an album, a story is told with a lot of perspective, lessons and prayers. It covers his journey to fame and success, the way he handles it, and the satisfaction of starting a family. I really enjoyed his insightful lessons through his fifty years of living. One moment that really struck out to me was his rite of passage of becoming a man, which was intertwined with his relationship with his father. The book also reminded me that we all face challenges no matter who we are, what economic situations we face, and what we have accomplished.

Some say the book is self centered and egotistical, but I personally did not find this a problem as the book was presented as a memoir. While my path will look entirely different from his, I think his general observations hold up for everyone. Enjoy life. Live it to its full potential. Make sure to look back and see how far you've come.

**Overall Rating: 7.5/10**
