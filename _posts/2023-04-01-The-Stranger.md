![The Stranger](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1507384334i/24111720._SX540_.jpg)

Nobel Prize-winning author Albert Camus' _The Stranger_ highlights the ironies of enforcing meaning in a void and the absurdities that surround us as we all walk towards the same lifeless fate. 'Since we're all going to die,' the protagonist says, 'it's obvious that when and how don't matter.' Le Monde ranked it as number one on its 100 books of the century list, so naturally, I came into this novel a bit skeptical of its critical acclaim.

Despite it's short runspan, _The Stranger_ is certainly worthy of its praise. Even though its writing style can be rather dull and overly simple, I was shocked in the end how each line seemed to play a part in the final outcome of Meursault's ending both physically and mentally. Camus' prose mirrors one of a professional athlete - there is no excessive movement or effort. The writing is incredible efficient, deliberate, and graceful.

One reason why the novel's simple writing style is so effective is that it mirrors the mindset of its protagonist, Meursault. The novel is a classic early modern work of anomie, alienation and a general indifference to life. Meursault is a man who sees the world in a straightforward way without the embellishments of emotion. The novel's spare, unadorned language captures this mindset perfectly, allowing readers to see the world through Meursault's eyes and to experience his sense of detachment and indifference.

In addition, the simplicity serves to emphasize the novel's take on existentialism. By stripping away the artifice and ornamentation of language, Camus highlights the essential absurdity of human existence and the futility of attempting to find meaning in a meaningless world. The simplicity of the language underscores the novel's central message that life is ultimately incomprehensible and that our attempts to impose order and meaning on it are ultimately futile.

This book reminds me of all the times that I have stepped in a room and felt out of place. Even though I doubt Camus in his time considered the impact of global pandemics and the digital 21st century world, he understood the slippery slope of self isolation and how it could unravel deep beliefs. Camus reminds me that each and every one of us is nothing more than a stranger.

**Overall Rating: 9/10**
