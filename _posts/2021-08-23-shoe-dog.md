> I’d tell men and women in their midtwenties not to settle for a job or a profession or even a career. Seek a calling. Even if you don’t know what that means, seek it. If you’re following your calling, the fatigue will be easier to bear, the disappointments will be fuel, the highs will be like nothing you’ve ever felt.

I want to begin this book by saying that I have read this book three times and own a hardcover copy of this book. Shoe Dog is simply a memoir of Phil Knight, one of the cofounders of Nike, that covers the journey of Blue Ribbon Sports and its transformation into Nike as we know it today. While it is easy to dismiss this as just another business memoir, it is filled with many insightful lessons and stories that made me really understand and appreciate Nike.

I never thought that I would care so much for a big corporation, but Phil is just a very likeable person. I like how real he is - his struggles to find himself in a world that seemed to move so quickly, his courage, drive, and dare throughout his moments of self doubt, and his own realizations and insights that offset his imperfections. The highs of the book really highlight what it means to pursue a passion, and how important it is to have a team around you that makes your highs feel ever higher. The lows of the book show the real side of business, how people are out to get you, the real pressure of feeding your family on the brink of bankruptcy, and the fear of imprisonment attempting something that has never been done before.

When I first read this book at 17, it really pushed me to find my own passions in life. It taught me to take risks even if my idea sounds crazy, because everything sounds crazy until it works. Every time I have read this book after my first read, I walked away with smaller lessons and a greater appreciation for Phil's story and what he stands for. This book goes down as one of my favorites of all time, and I strongly recommend anyone that is reading this to check it out.

**Overall Rating: 10/10**
