Ruja Ignatova is notably the only woman on the FBI's top 10 most wanted list, for running one of the largest scams in the world and disappearing into the void from her investors. In _The Missing Cryptoqueen_, Jamie Bartlett retells how this all came to be - Ignatova's come up in Bulgaria, her short stint at McKinsey and how she sold a pyramid scheme with the promise of a blockchain that didn't ever exist.

Ruja Ignatova's OneCoin cryptocurrency was built off of the Bitcoin hype in the earlier days of 2015, capturing the FOMO (that is the fear of missing out) of Bitcoin and building momentum using a multi-level marketing scheme. Rather than selling the coin itself, the OneCoin marketers sold the dream of financial independence.

While many of Ignatova's colleagues have been captured and put into trial, the whereabouts of Ruja is still unknown. Her assets are hidden, her appearance looks entirely different through plastic surgery, and she is protected by corrupt foreign governments. Rumor has it she is still living in the ocean somewhere free from jurisdiction of any country on a superyacht.

The book does a great job covering the basics of cryptocurrency, how mining blocks and increasing supply debunked many of OneCoin's fundamentals. Bartlett does this to educate his audience of course, but also to point out how no one truly understood the product, and only bought in due to the allure of Ignatova. It also served as a grave warning of the underlying issues of MLM marketing and the damaging effect it has at the lowest level.

My only complaint of this book is that is stretches out every detail and attempts to dramatize everything for the sake of an interesting read. While it starts off strong, it turns a bit sour near the end where it became theatrically painful. Parts of the story would have served much better as a Wikipedia page or short news article.

Despite all this, the book overall is a great read, especially for true financial crime fans such as myself. It's stunning to know that there are still believers out there, waiting for her return despite all of the facts being uncovered. They are far too deep to back out, so they refuse to believe what is in front of them. We are truly living in a post-truth world.

**Overall Rating: 7/10**
