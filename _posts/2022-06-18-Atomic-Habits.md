> You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

I recently went back to one of my favorite self help books Atomic Habits, written by James Clear. Self help books are very hit or miss, usually depending on the way each reader creates action out of the material in the book. Luckily, Atomic Habits hones in on building an environment of healthy habit building rather than setting multiple goals to build success. As Clear puts it - winners and losers have the same goals. Every Olympian wants to win a gold medal, but merely setting the objective does not merit success, because if it did, millions of people would have gold medals. The system behind the goal is what produces result. If you want a more comprehensive summary of the book rather than my personal thoughts, click [here](https://www.getstoryshots.com/books/atomic-habits-summary/#:~:text=Atomic%20habits%20are%20the%20compound%20interest%20of%20self-improvement.,or%20even%20no%20difference%20on%20any%20given%20day.).

Clear begins with the fundamentals of the human brain and what motivates the systems. He breaks down dopamine which triggers our reward system, and lists conditioning, the concept of improving, and building momentum as hurdles. With this definition, he moves onto focusing on habit loops (the cue that leads to craving which leads to a certain response and reward) and four laws to build a system that works for you.

Each of the four laws are simple in concept with many examples to follow. The way the book is divided and structured really emphasizes the importance of each step, and it feels that without all of them working together as a whole, our habit system is vulnerable to falling apart. As someone who used to struggle a lot to change habits, this book helped me change my underlying beliefs and identity while motivating me to craft them the right way throughout college. I like to compare my own battles to build habits as a basketball franchise like the Warriors - the culture, environment, and players all need to be built with the right system to thrive over a long period of time. One moment often does not alter the trajectory of our goals and existence. Despite the way it often feels on social media, Atomic Habits reminds me that itâ€™s a marathon, not a race.
