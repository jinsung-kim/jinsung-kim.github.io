> We tell ourselves stories in order to live... We look for the sermon in the suicide, for the social or moral lesson in the murder of five. We interpret what we see, select the most workable of the multiple choices.

Published in 1979, _The White Album_ is a collection of essays by Joan Didion that explores the aftermath of the 1960s. In this collection, Didion delves into the events of the decade, prominent figures, and the defining ideas of the generation, all through her unique perspective. With her keen observations, she vividly portrays the chaotic culture of the era and offers an engaging commentary on the state of American ideals and aspirations like an untouched time capsule.

While this type of nonfiction short essay format hasn't typically resonated with me in the past, many of the essays in this book left me utterly captivated by every word. Didion writes with a certain assuredness that can at times feel somewhat distant but is undeniably sharp. She often refrains from inserting her own perspective, maintaining a cool and objective tone. Her writing is notably devoid of embellishments and excessive adjectives. Despite this understated quality, she effectively conveys her message, leaving a lasting impression. Even when she weaves together historical ideas that might cause my attention to wander, she effortlessly ties it all together with one magnificent sentence.

While the key events she covers, such as the Black Panther movement, are undeniably interesting, my favorite essays are the ones where she delves into her experiences with migraines and her imaginative explorations of water's pathways. Didion not only contemplates her ideas but also takes the initiative to investigate them in the real world. Despite my initial skepticism about topics like irrigation infrastructure or empty Governorsâ€™ mansions, Joan manages to maintain my interest and draw powerful insights with compelling implications for the times.

As much of Didion's writing is set in San Francisco and the broader Bay Area, reading her work has given me a newfound appreciation for the place I find myself in after graduation. It has ignited in me a desire to explore more and create my own unique interactions with this environment. In a way, I aspire to embody her cool Californian style and embark on my own journey.

I've come to the realization that it's often the seemingly ordinary aspects of life that truly matter, and this is how I should approach my own life. The mundane and personal can inspire the most beautiful ideas within us. Growth and transformation often emerge from periods of uncertainty and not knowing. The challenges faced by a lost soul can ultimately lead to the greatest moments of joy. In sum, Didion has taught me that I've been living life the wrong way all along.
