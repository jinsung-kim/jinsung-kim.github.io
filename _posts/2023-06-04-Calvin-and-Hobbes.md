_Calvin and Hobbes_ is a beloved comic strip created by Bill Watterson that ran from 1985 to 1995. The strip primarily revolves around the imaginative adventures of a young boy named Calvin and his stuffed tiger, Hobbes, who comes to life in Calvin's imagination. The strip often captures the essence of suburban life in the American Midwest, with its scenic landscapes, changing seasons, and idyllic neighborhoods. Despite being written before the millenium, Watterson's strip offers a nostalgic element and a timeless appeal.

As a child, reading Calvin and Hobbes, many of the strip's jokes and philosophical discussions often went over my head. However, upon revisiting the comics as an adult, I gained a newfound appreciation for the depth and complexity within the series. In particular, I found Watterson's exploration of philosophical take on existentialism very thought provoking. Through Calvin's vivid imagination and his conversations with Hobbes, the strip effortlessly delves into questions regarding the meaning of life, the nature of reality, and the human condition, skillfully interwoven with very lighthearted storytelling.

The most endearing quality of Calvin and Hobbes is its ability to transform the ordinary into extraordinary adventures. While I pondered whether Calvin was a schizophrenic, I chose to interpret his stories to the boundless imagination of childhood - a glimpse of the unrestricted world before facing the limitations and responsibility of adulthood.

In a lot of ways, Calvin's constant battle to escape the mundane mirrors the existential yearning and questioning found in a lot of other books that I like. I love the different reactions characters have as they attempt to seek answers and meaning of an unresponsive world. The absurdity of existence, resonates in this strip with Calvin's questioning nature and his attempts to find purpose in a world that often appears confusing and unyielding.

Calvin and Hobbes serves as a great reminder to seek out the portals of adventure in the midst of the mundane. It encourages us to approach life with that childlike curiosity, and learn to appreciate the simplest moments. Watterson prompts us to live in the present, even in the moments of boredom and stillness. Given our fast paced technology driven world, Calvin and Hobbes reminds me to disconnect more frequently and explore the outdoors.
