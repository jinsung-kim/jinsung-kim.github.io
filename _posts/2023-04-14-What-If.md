> What would happen if everyone on Earth stood as close to each other as they could and jumped, everyone landing on the ground at the same instant?

> This crowd takes up an area the size of Rhode Island. But there’s no reason to use the vague phrase “an area the size of Rhode Island.” This is our scenario; we can be specific. They’re actually in Rhode Island.

> As discussed elsewhere, it doesn’t really affect the planet. Earth outweighs us by a factor of over ten trillion. On average, we humans can vertically jump maybe half a meter on a good day. Even if the Earth were rigid and responded instantly, it would be pushed down by less than an atom’s width.

> Seconds pass. Everyone looks around. There are a lot of uncomfortable glances. Someone coughs.

> Rhode Island’s half-million cars are commandeered. Moments later, I-95, I-195, and I-295 become the sites of the largest traffic jam in the history of the planet. Most of the cars are engulfed by the crowds, but a lucky few get out and begin wandering the abandoned road network.

> The edge of the crowd spreads outward into southern Massachusetts and Connecticut. Any two people who meet are unlikely to have a language in common, and almost nobody knows the area. The state becomes a chaotic patchwork of coalescing and collapsing social hierarchies. Violence is common. Everybody is hungry and thirsty. Grocery stores are emptied. Fresh water is hard to come by and there’s no efficient system for distributing it.

> Within weeks, Rhode Island is a graveyard of billions ... But at least we know.

In the book _What If_, former NASA roboticist and _xkcd_ creator Randall Munroe answers questions about absurd situations that I didn't know I needed to know. What makes _What If_ an engaging read is Munroe's ability to take complex scientific concepts and distill them in layman's terms. Whether he is exploring the consequence of a hypothetical nuclear explosion or explaining the physical breakdown of a baseball thrown at near-light speed, Munroe is engaging within his narration.

Munroe's _xkcd_ humor is on full display throughout _What If_. He explains the dangers of inbreeding by explaining DNA sequences with a _Dungeons & Dragons_ stat breakdown. He converts the likelihood of a student guessing a perfect score on the SAT in number of consecutive lightning strikes. Whether he's riffing on the absurdity of the scenarios that he's analyzing or cracking engineering jokes, Munroe manages to do a lot even though this is not his traditional form of work.

While his thoughtfulness is certainly to be admired, I did find myself sometimes bored of how complicated he would complicate certain scenarios. His thoroughness in his approach to explore all angles of a question is certainly a great strength if the question is interesting, but for the occasional question that misses the mark, it quickly feels bloated and repetitive. Sometimes he would go on tangents with complex calculations that would inevitably lead to the same result.

Despite this quirk, _What If_ is a great book to digest in small doses for anyone who is interested in science, humor, or learning new things. Whether you are an advanced physicist or a very casual reader, you will be impressed with Munroe's creativity in the language of science.

**Overall Rating: 7/10**

Here is one of my favorite _xkcd_ comics:
