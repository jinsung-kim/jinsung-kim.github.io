![What clothes do artists work in?](https://image-cdn.hypb.st/https%3A%2F%2Fhypebeast.com%2Fimage%2F2021%2F05%2Fcharlie-porter-what-artists-wear-1.jpg?q=90&w=1400&cbr=1&fit=max)

The fashion industry is an interesting subject in our modern society, often criticized for excessive amounts of consumerism while also praised for seasonal story telling. The ability to form artistic vision out of something so functional is what differentiates us from other animals. In What Artists Wear, UK fashion journalist Charlie Porter dives into the different ways artists dress themselves, and looks to see where it stems from and how it impacts their work. Rather than reading like a manual on how to dress to replicate the look of contemporary artists, it offers a counterpoint to the often cynical artistic style that we are accustomed to seeing.

The main selling point for this book is easily the amount of pictures that it offers. Each picture is accompanied by context from the artist, and offer different settings that often times explain why one is dressed a certain way. Each chapter, sectioned off by a certain dressing style such as denim, revealed why the piece or dressing style was so popular amongst artists. This book took apart the idea that each item had to fit with the artists’ grand vision, but could also just serve a functional role to what the artist does. For instance, many performers and painters will turn to a “uniform” look to offer practicality and focus in their work. It was a pleasure reading through each artist’s story and journey through the art world.

Fashion journalism when done right can be layered because it has the ability to speak volumes about the society that we live in. The way Porter writes pushed me to think about the artfulness of people. I always knew that art and clothing are entwined, but this book really broke down why, and reconstructed my definition of both concepts entirely. After reading What Artists Wear, I will now take a deep look into my own wardrobe and uncover references to better articulate my own language of clothes.
