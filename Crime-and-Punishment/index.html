<p>The notion of committing a wrongful act is a fleeting yet universal human experience. But what happens when you act upon that intrusive thought? In Fyodor Dostoyevesky’s <em>Crime and Punishment</em>, Dostoyevesky narrates a story that takes place in St. Petersburg, following Rodion Raskolnikov, a student who conspires and murders a local pawnbroker, and the subsequent events that follow.</p>

<p>It’s easy to pin Raskolnikov as a bad person—and initially, it does feel that way. He compares himself to Napoleon and views himself as superior to the rest of society. The real crime, however, is his arrogance, which ultimately makes his guilt more harrowing than the thought of punishment. As the story progresses, Raskolnikov’s mental state reveals how his guilt affects those he loves. Dostoevsky displays a masterclass in storytelling and character complexity, highlighting the duality of humanity: the capacity for evil, but also the ability to feel shame and remorse.</p>

<p>While the first half of the book moves slowly, the plot quickly intensifies as it progresses. As it develops, there are flashes of philosophies reminiscent of Freud and Camus, even though Dostoevsky’s work predates their work. The strongest point of the book is undoubtedly the dialogues between the characters, where Dostoevsky masterfully weaves the narrative together. These conversations flow effortlessly, revealing the moral beliefs and individual challenges of each character.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, the struggle of Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov. His comedic rant about his own life is particularly poignant. He feeds his alcohol addiction with the earnings of his prostitute daughter Sonia and runs away from his family responsibilities, all while acknowledging his foolishness and shortcomings. The relationship between him and his daughter is especially complex, highlighting Sonia’s character as the story reveals her religious faith and resilience.</p>

<p>The chaotic pull between good and evil that resides within Rodya is the centerpiece of Dostoevsky’s novel. His mind, body, and soul are all conflicted by his inherent guilt, and the novel ensures that we see how Rodya is torn apart as he searches for a path to redemption. While these parts were extremely hard to digest, it seemed that Dostoevsky was trying to remind me of what it means to be human. I realized that everyone struggles with moral contradictions and conscience. What am I doing to amend the mistakes in my life?</p>

  <p>Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart. The really great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth.</p>
